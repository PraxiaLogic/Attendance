# Attendance
Context
Schools in England and Wales are required to record and monitor their student attendance.
This role is performed by an Attendance Officer, AO; on a salary of around Â£21k p/a.
A parent, carer or occassionaly the student will contact the school to notify them of an unplanned absence. 
They will also contact the AO to request permission for a planned absence for something like a medical appointment, or holiday during term time.
Contact is made with the AO through email, telephone or by voicemail.
The AO then records the details given and manually enters these into the School Administration System.
This is inefficient use of time and money, and it introduces the potential of incorrect data entry, or it not being entered at all.
